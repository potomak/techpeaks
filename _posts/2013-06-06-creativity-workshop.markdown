Slava Kozlov, TechPeaks mentor and senior research consultant at Philips, proposed a workshop about creativity. He spoke about Philips and he presented some examples of creativity applied to technology.

Customers are not only customers, *they are people* and you should trust people.

He gave the example of LivingColors. Surveys and focus groups didn't accept that product. Philips than tried to give prototypes to people for free. People were using the light in unexpected ways and this made the company think about new businesses for the product making it a market success.

While working at Philips he tried to imagine objects of the future. A study after 15 years showed that only 15% of the prototypes imagined by his team has been made by Philips.

I think it's hard to imagine the future but it's even harder to believe in that future.

We met researchers from Trentino's research departments. Most technology startups are willing to have partners in research institutes and Trentino is a good place to start such partnerships.
