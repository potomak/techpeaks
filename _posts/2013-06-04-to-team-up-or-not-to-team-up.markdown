title: To team up or not to team up
description: Team formation phase and wrap up about the LSM with Adam.
---

We discussed with Diana about differences between teams and groups. Just remember that *groups are a superset of teams*.

We started to form the teams. I didn't join any team and this made me feel *frustrated*. I didn't feel part of any team but the worst part is that I didn't try to convince anyone to join me to work on issuehunter.

I talked about it with Evan and it came out that I have two options:

1. to go home and work on my idea by myself
1. to stay at TechPeaks, even without a team, to work on issuehunter, to know a lot of new people and maybe try later to form a team

It helped me a lot to clarify my opportunities.

We all made a *wrap up* with Adam about LSM and than I had a personal interview with him where we talked about the best experiment to run to validate issuehunter's riskiest assumptions that *people are willing to pay to get software issues resolved*. I'll set up a form requesting informations to people which are willing to pay and I need at least *one hundred* of them in order to validate the assumption. 

To relax after the arduous day I drank a couple of beers with Alessandro and [Ivan](http://twitter.com/iuanaui).
