Yesterday I didn't sleep at all, I was too excited about this trip.

This morning I took the train to Trento, about three hours and a half of trip through Alpi mountains.

I took the keys of my accomodation: I'll live in an apartment for students, a recent building, it's little and comfortable. I think I'm going to ask for a bike to move freely in Trento, they give you one *as a service*.

Than I registered myself and signed the contract at TechPeaks Basecamp.

Now I'm writing from *"Il Simposio"* while drinking a *Ugo*, a local drink.

**Update:** the *official song* of this trip (I can't take it out of my head and I hear it everywhere) is [Biblical](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrbMNBNMksk) by Biffy Clyro.
