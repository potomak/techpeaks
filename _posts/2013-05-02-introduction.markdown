I've been selected to attend the first edition of [TeckPeaks boot camp](http://techpeaks.eu). The boot camp will start at May the 30th and I'll stay in Trento at least for three months trying to learn from *[top-notch mentors](http://techpeaks.eu/mentors/)* how to run [my own startup](http://issuehunter.co).

This is the place where I'll put contents and maybe some *objective considerations* about this experience in Trento. I'll try to write a new post everyday as an excercise and also to be sure not to miss recording anything from this adventure.
