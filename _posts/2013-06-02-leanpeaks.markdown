Results from our last experiment validated our hypotheses. We built a concierge: a google form with five questions to get motivated about your diet habit but we didn't experienced our solution because we were out of time.

Adam spoke about *refining* versus *exploration*. You should explore to find the real problem to solve and only after this process you should start refining your solution otherwise it's hard to know if you're refining the solution to the right problem.

Riccardo pitched about the process we followed and our resulting solution.

Michele won with Climb Guru, a service to announce weather to climbers. He also succeeded in selling his solution to some climbers.

A great advice from Evan I forgot to mention earlier: *"if you don't help al least one person each day we all lose"*.

We had an [aperitif] with mentors from the Lean Startup Machine. I met [Toti](http://twitter.com/totididio), a friend of Damiano who is running his own startup in Palermo.

We went to eat some tasty Trentino food and that we headed to the first TechPeaks unofficial party. We were chatting, drinking and dancing but somebody called the police so we had to stop the party. I had fun, we should repeat the experiment!
