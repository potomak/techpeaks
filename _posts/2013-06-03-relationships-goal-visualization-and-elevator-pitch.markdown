title: Relationships, goal visualization and elevator pitch
description: Workshops with Diana, Polina and Evan about team management, motivation and how to develop your elevator pitch.

I had breakfast with [Marco De Nadai](http://twitter.com/denadai2â€Ž), he helped me building the first prototype of issuehunter at Brescia less than one year ago.

## Dealing with relationships

We worked with Diana to know more about how to deal with relationships in a team. She used a tool called *Strength Deployment Inventory*.

> Strength Deployment Inventory is a tool for managing conflict and improving relationships. It is based on the theory a learning model for identifying and understanding the motivation behind behavior.

Came out that I'm *green/red*:

> Concern for intelligent assertiveness, justice, leadership, order, and fairness in competition.

## The mastery walk

With Polina we went to park S. Chiara where we started the *mastery walk*, a path to better visualize success and that should help us achieving our goals.

The mastery walk is composed by five stages:

1. formulation (formulate your goal and declare what you want to achieve)
1. discovery (getting started and keep going)
1. momentum (results and competences acquired)
1. stability (comfort zone)
1. mastery (self-consistent, ideal place)

We virtually walked the path from formulation to mastery and than in the reverse way, from mastery to formulation, to understand better steps needed to reach success.

## The elevator pitch

An elevator pitch must last at most 30 seconds and it should get people excited, it should make people *grab their heart out of their chest*. The goal is to make people say: "WOW!". Remember that you're aiming for a second meeting.

The five major components of an elevator pitch:

1. oppotunity (which market are you targeting)
1. problem
1. solution
1. traction (who is using your product, growth rate)
1. team[^foot]

You should focus on:

* stare in their eyes
* be confident, determined
* concise
* clear
* compelling: explain the problem
* credible
* concrete
* customized
* consistent

You must excercise a lot, the best way is to **record your pitch** at least 50 times per week. If you don't believe yourself who is going to believe you?
