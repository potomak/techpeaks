title: Why am I writing this blog?
description: Some of the reasons because I'm writing the TechPeaks Log.
---

A couple of days ago I met [Michele](http://twitter.com/realfuzzy), a friend of mine, he's a programmer. We spoke about our new projects and I told him about my successful application to TechPeaks acceleration program. I told him also about the project of this blog and he came out with a lot of interesting observations.

> Why a jekyll site and not simple G+ posts or any other publishing platform?

First of all because I really enjoy to hack with jekyll. Also because *it's mine*, I'm hosting the repo at [http://github.com/potomak/techpeaks](http://github.com/potomak/techpeaks) and the HTML code at GitHub pages but I feel better than putting these contents on G+.

> Why a public log? Why can't you just write your thoughts on a notebook?

Because I hope it could be useful for other people and also because I hope to feel more commitment with a potential audience.

I know that there are some drawbacks about this choice,[^foot] I need to pay a lot of attention to what I'm going to write. That's why I'll try my best to write posts telling more facts than personal opinions even if it's more easy to have debates on opinions.

Another positive aspect about the publication of this blog is that I'd be happy to get feedback about posts and to start conversations on them.

I'm doing it also because I'd like to improve my english and I think this could be a fun way to do it.

Last but not least, I'm going to do it as an excercise: one post every day. I've been inspired by [Matteo](http://twitter.com/matteodepalo), a friend of mine and co-founder of the [Hackatron](http://hackatron.org) community, he wrote a post almost every day of the trip in his personal log during our stay in Berlin.
