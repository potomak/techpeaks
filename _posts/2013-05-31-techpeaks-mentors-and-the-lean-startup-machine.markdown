title: TechPeaks Mentors and the Lean Startup Machine
description: Introduction of some of the mentors and first day of the Lean Startup Machine [program]
---

[Evan Nisselson](http://twitter.com/nisselson) pitched this morning. He is a serial entrepreneur and a professional photographer. He spoke about his experiences as an entrepreneur, what did well and what did not and why. The risks he took with his companies and the failures he made between successes.

He told us about *timing*: you should choose the right timing to build for your idea; *expertise domain*: you should do something in a field that you know; *trust* between you and your customers and between you and your investors: be always transparent with your customers and pretend transparency from your investors.

We pitched ourselfs to introduce each others and then we made elevator pitches about our ideas. A couple are about crowdfunding.

James Roberts from Global Capital Law pitched about *Starting up a start up* where he told us the best way to get the best from our experience here at TechPeaks and how to relate with mentors. He also told us about the *perfect slides deck*: you should make it as clear as possibile, also remind to mention *where you are now* and *where you want to go* with your idea, not literaly of course.

Than we had some crazy time trying to apply the *lean startup* methodology with guys from the Lean Startup Machine.

[Adam Berk](http://twitter.com/adamberk) introduced the process and some of us pitched problems fitting this kind of processing. Some of the ideas were selected, we divided into teams and we started to fill the *validation board* with *problem hypothesis* and *customers hypothesis*. We filled the *core assumptions* that make those hypotheses true and selected the riskies to get validated by the first experiment.

I'm trying with my team to validate the problem of making underweight people to gain weight by asking people some questions about the assumpion that to gain weight they would change their diet. Tomorrow we'll analyze data to know if our hypotheses have been proved or not and go on with the first *pivot*.
