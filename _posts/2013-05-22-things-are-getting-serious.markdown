title: Things are getting serious
description: Contract signed and accomodation requested.

Yesterday I signed the contract[^foot].

Today I fulfilled the form to get an apartment in Trento.

I'll be in Trento from May 29th, *things are getting serious*.

[^foot]: I agreed not to disclose to third parties any confidential information of which I 
become acquainted with within the context of the TechPeaks Program, so I'm a little bit worried about what I can write in this blog without violating this contract.
